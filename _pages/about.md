I am a certified and licensed speech-language pathologist driven to develop scientific tools that enhance the assessment and treatment of individuals with speech and language disorders. I am completing my doctoral training with [Dr. Jonathan Preston](https://thecollege.syr.edu/people/faculty/preston-jonathan-l/) in the [Syracuse University Speech Production Lab](http://speechproductionlab.syr.edu/). My ongoing projects can be summarized through the following research themes:

## Improving treatment outcomes for children with residual speech errors and identifing factors related to treatment non-response.

Childhood speech sound disorder, which impacts an estimated [16% of children at the age of 3 years]( https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8624.7402002), continues to impact approximately [1-2% of the population](https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0035-1562905) in adulthood. Individuals with these residual speech errors may experience a [lifetime of detrimental educational, occupational, and social outcomes](https://doi.org/10.1080/17549500802676859). Evidence shows that therapy including [biofeedback](https://doi.org/10.1044/2016_JSLHR-S-16-0038) [enhances](https://doi.org/10.1044/2019_AJSLP-18-0261) outcomes for some children, adolescents, and adults with speech sound disorder, and it may be possible to [further improve biofeedback treatment outcomes](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-020-1941-5) by matching client characteristics to specific biofeedback modalities.

Some children, however, [do not respond](https://doi.org/10.1044/2016_JSLHR-S-16-0038) to high-quality speech sound therapy. Factors influencing treatment non-response are unknown. I believe that the identification of these factors, including the cognitive processing of clinical feedback, can be used to improve best practices in intervention and reduce the number of individuals with residual speech errors in adulthood. 

## Strengthening diagnostic feature sets for childhood apraxia of speech in order to improve treatment outcomes.

Clinicians and researchers must make diagnostic judgements regarding the presence or absence of childhood apraxia of speech, a [neurologically-based speech sound disorder](https://www.asha.org/Practice-Portal/Clinical-Topics/Childhood-Apraxia-of-speech/), in order to design appropriate treatment plans and answer related research questions. There is a [lack of consensus](https://doi.org/10.1044/2016_JSLHR-S-15-0296), however, regarding the checklists, features, and clinical tests that can best describe childhood apraxia of speech. I believe that conceptualizing childhood apraxia of speech as a spectrum of difficulty that presents differently over the course of development is important to reconcile the [seemingly conflicting](https://doi.org/10.1044/2020_PERSP-19-00086) descriptions of apraxic speech features in the literature. By moving away from a small set of "cannonical features" will increase the emphasis on treatment planning that addresses each child's unique presentation.  

## Optimizing acoustic analysis and child speech recognition in order to improve research workflow and the development of treatment tools that rely on automatic speech recognition.

Acoustic analysis, which can be used to measure speech research outcomes, and automatic speech recognition, which can be used in clinical tools, share common underlying principles and utility. Generally, there is a [lack of publicly-available, manually transcribed child language training data](https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2019.2959393) to create tools specialized to automate _child_ acoustic analysis and speech recognition. Error rates are generally [higher](http://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2018/abstracts/2297.html) when analyzing child speech, because [tools aren't necessarially trained on child speech](https://doi.org/10.1044/2018_JSLHR-S-17-0275) and because child speech and language are [inherently different](https://doi.org/10.1145/2909824.3020229) than the adult speech and language the systems _are_ trained on. I believe that training speech recognition systems on child speech data that includes information about age, phonetic errors, and morpho-phonological structure will improve the accuracy of these systems. This advancement would increase the utility of automated analysis as a research and clinical tool for children with developmental language disorders and speech sound disorders. 

## Enhancing automated language sample analysis through natural language processing in order to improve clinical access to validated language sample analysis methods.

Language sample analysis is an [important but underutilized clinical assessment tool](https://doi.org/10.1044/2016_LSHSS-15-0044). Advances in natural language processing over the past decade can be leveraged to offset resource barriers to the widespread inclusion of language sampling in the routine practice of SLPs, including in telepractice situations. Previous attempts, however, to automate identification of child language disorder have not demonstrated clinically-acceptable accuracy. I am working with the developers of [SUGAR](www.sugarlanguage.org) to automate their validated language sample process. I believe that automated language sample analysis can achieve similar performance as manual language sample analysis when automated tools follow the [best practices already validated](https://doi.org/10.1044/2018_LSHSS-18-0050) within speech-language pathology, and that this approach will yield clinically acceptable diagnostic accuracy levels that [deep learning techniques](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2011.08.001) have failed to achieve thus far.
