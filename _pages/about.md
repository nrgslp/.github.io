I am a certified and licensed speech-language pathologist driven to develop scientific tools that enhance the assessment and treatment of individuals with speech and language disorders. I am completing my doctoral training with [Dr. Jonathan Preston](https://thecollege.syr.edu/people/faculty/preston-jonathan-l/) in the [Syracuse University Speech Production Lab](http://speechproductionlab.syr.edu/). My ongoing projects can be summarized by the following research themes:

## Improving treatment outcomes for children with residual speech errors and identifing factors related to treatment non-response.

Childhood speech sound disorder, which impacts an estimated [16% of children at the age of 3 years]( https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8624.7402002), continues to impact approximately [1-2% of the population](https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0035-1562905) in adulthood. Individuals with these residual speech errors may experience a [lifetime of detrimental educational, occupational, and social outcomes](https://doi.org/10.1080/17549500802676859). Evidence shows that [biofeedback](https://doi.org/10.1044/2016_JSLHR-S-16-0038) [enhances](https://doi.org/10.1044/2019_AJSLP-18-0261) intervention outcomes for some children, adolescents, and adults with speech sound disorder, and it may be possible to [further improve biofeedback treatment outcomes](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-020-1941-5) by matching client profiles to specific biofeedback modalities.

Some children, however, [do not](https://doi.org/10.1044/2016_JSLHR-S-16-0038) [respond](https://doi.org/10.1044/2019_AJSLP-18-0261) to high-quality intervention. Factors influencing treatment non-response are unknown. I believe that the identification of these factors, including the cognitive processing of clinical feedback, can improve best practices in intervention and reduce the number of individuals with residual speech errors in adulthood. 

## Strengthening diagnostic featuresets for childhood apraxia of speech in order to improve treatment outcomes.

Clinicians and researchers must make diagnostic judgements regarding the presence or absence of childhood apraxia of speech in order to design appropriate treatment plans and answer related research questions. There is a [lack of consensus](https://doi.org/10.1044/2016_JSLHR-S-15-0296), however, regarding the checklists, features, and tests that can best describe childhood apraxia of speech. I believe that conceptualizing childhood apraxia of speech as a spectrum of difficulty that presents differently over the course of development is important to reconsile the [seemingly-conflicting](https://doi.org/10.1044/2020_PERSP-19-00086) descriptions of apraxic speech features in the literature as well as to design treatments that address each child's unique presentation.  

## Optimizing acoustic analysis and child speech recognition in order to improve research workflow and the development of treatment tools that rely on automatic speech recognition.

Acoustic analysis, which can be used to measure speech research outcomes, and automatic speech recognition, which can be used in clinical tools, share common underlying principles and utility. Generally, however, there is a [lack of publicly-available, manually transcribed child language training data](https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2019.2959393) to create tools specialized to automate _child_ acoustic analysis and speech recognition. Error rates are generally [higher](http://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2018/abstracts/2297.html) when analyzing child speech, which can happen when [tools aren't optimized for child speakers](https://doi.org/10.1044/2018_JSLHR-S-17-0275) or because child speech and language are [inherently different](https://doi.org/10.1145/2909824.3020229) than adult speech and language. I believe that training acoustic and language models on child speech audio corpora that includes information about age, gender, phonetic errors, and morpho-phonological structure will improve the accuracy of these systems. This advancement would increase the utility of automated analysis as a research and clinical tool for children with developmental language disorders and speech sound disorders. 

## Enhancing automated language sample analysis through natural language processing in order to improve clinical access to validated language sample analysis methods.

Language sample analysis is an [important but underutilized clinical tool](https://doi.org/10.1044/2016_LSHSS-15-0044). Advances in natural language processing over the past decade can be leveraged to offset resource barriers to the widespread inclusion of language sampling in the routine practice of SLPs, including in telepractice. Previous attempts, however, to automate identification of child language disorder have not demonstrated clinically-acceptable accuracy. I am working with the developers of [SUGAR](www.sugarlanguage.org) to automate their validated language sample process. I believe that automated language sample analysis can achieve similar performance as manual language sample analysis when built off of the [best practices already validated](https://doi.org/10.1044/2018_LSHSS-18-0050) within speech-lanuage pathology, and that this approach will yield clinically acceptable diagnostic accuracy levels that [deep learning techniques](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2011.08.001) have thus far failed to achieve.
