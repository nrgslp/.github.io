I am a certified and licensed speech-language pathologist driven to develop scientific tools that enhance the assessment and treatment of individuals with communication disorders. I am completing my doctoral training with [Dr. Jonathan Preston](https://thecollege.syr.edu/people/faculty/preston-jonathan-l/) in the [Syracuse University Speech Production Lab](http://speechproductionlab.syr.edu/). Here is a sample of my ongoing projects:

### Comparing the use of ultrasound biofeedback and visual acoustic biofeedback in children with residual speech errors.

### Optimizing acoustic analysis and child speech recognition.
